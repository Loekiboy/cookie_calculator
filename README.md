🍪 **Cookie Calculator**
Cookie Calculator is a dynamic, physics-based web experience that helps you bake the perfect batch of cookies. Whether you want 10 or 80 cookies, just slide the bar and watch the ingredients (and the cookies!) adjust in real-time.

The entire site is designed with one goal: Ultimate Satisfaction.

**Features**
- Interactive Physics Container: Watch cookies spawn, fall, and stack using a custom Matter.js engine.
- The "satisfying" Experience: A highly responsive slider with dynamic audio. It "pops" when you add cookies and "crunches" when you remove them.
- Live Ingredient Cards: Beautifully styled cards that update instantly. It even calculates tricky things like "1.6 eggs" so your ratio is always perfect.
- Dynamic Recipe Instructions: The baking steps update alongside the ingredients, telling you exactly how much of your whisked egg mixture to use.
- Aesthetic UI: A hand-drawn, cozy vibe that feels right at home in any kitchen.

**Technical Details**
- Engine: Matter.js for 2D physics.
- Audio: Web Audio API for procedurally generated sound effects.
- Environment: Developed on Linux Mint using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.
